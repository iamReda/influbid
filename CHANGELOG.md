# Changelog

## 2026-08-18

### Changed

#### Dependencies

- **Production dependencies**: Bumped `es-toolkit` to `^1.51.0`. Refresh the lockfile with `pnpm install` after pulling. `pnpm-workspace.yaml` enforces `minimumReleaseAge: 1440` (one day) at install time.

## 2026-08-17

### Changed

#### UI

- **Toasts now use Base UI**: `packages/ui/components/toast.tsx` is rebuilt on `@base-ui/react/toast` (following the shadcn Base UI toast) and `sonner` was removed from the workspace. The `toastSuccess`, `toastError`, `toastInfo`, `toastWarning`, `toastLoading`, `toastPromise` and `dismiss` helpers were removed; use the exported `toast` manager directly (`toast.add({ title, description, type: "success" })`, `toast.close(id)`, `toast.promise(promise, { loading: { title }, success: { title }, error: { title } })`). `Toaster` still accepts `position` and takes a translated `closeLabel` for the dismiss button (`common.aria.closeToast`), and the toast primitives (`Toast`, `ToastContent`, `ToastTitle`, `ToastDescription`, `ToastAction`, `ToastClose`, `ToastViewport`, ...) are exported for custom toasts. Run `pnpm install` after pulling.

## 2026-08-13

### Changed

#### Page titles

- **Document title**: Marketing and SaaS now use `{page} – {appName}` (en dash) instead of a pipe. Every SaaS page sets a title so tabs read like `Welcome back – supastarter for Next.js Demo` rather than the product name alone.
- **Blog list**: The tab title and page-header eyebrow now say `Blog`. The H1 stays `Notes from the product`.
- **Hero preview**: The dashboard mock’s drop shadow is no longer clipped at the bottom. The section no longer uses `overflow-x-hidden` around the preview, and the mock has enough bottom padding for the full blur.

#### UI

- **Mail templates**: The shared mail wrapper is a bit wider (640px) with more padding and 16px body copy, so transactional emails are less cramped. The primary button matches that scale.
- **Form controls**: Inputs, selects, and textareas use `rounded-xl` so their corners sit closer to the pill buttons and other rounder surfaces.
- **Alerts**: Feedback alerts use `rounded-xl` to match the form controls. Success, error, and warning now use Tailwind `green-800`/`green-400`, `red-700`/`red-400`, and `yellow-700`/`yellow-500` instead of custom oklch values.
- **Logo**: The middle bar of the shared Acme mark uses the chromatic olive touch color.
- **App icon**: Replaced the rocket `icon.png` in marketing, SaaS, and docs with the three-bar Acme mark. The middle bar uses the chromatic olive touch color.
- **SaaS touch color**: The chromatic olive is used as a state hint in the product: active nav icons, settings/tab underlines, checked switches, unread notification badges, active/recommended plans, the chat send control, and organization logo placeholders.
- **Marketing type scale**: Replaced one-off font sizes (`text-[2.5rem]`, `text-[11px]`, and similar) with the nearest Tailwind tokens so marketing type stays on the shared scale.
- **Docs typography**: The docs app now uses the same pairing as marketing—Inter for body copy and DM Sans for headings and the wordmark.
- **Accordion**: FAQ panels animate height with `--accordion-panel-height` and a longer ease, so open/close no longer snaps.
- **Locale switch**: Moved the duplicated marketing/SaaS language pickers into `@repo/ui`. Apps pass locales, the current value, and a persist callback so the UI package stays free of `@repo/i18n`.
- **Feature headlines**: Product feature spreads no longer show an icon above the top-level title; the three-up benefit grid still does.
- **Inner pages**: Blog, changelog, and contact use the same left-aligned header as the homepage (olive eyebrow, stacked title and lede). Changelog is a dated timeline with six example releases; the journal has product-shaped sample posts.
- **Marketing container**: The marketing `container` max-width steps down from `7xl` to `6xl` so the public pages sit a bit narrower.
- **SaaS logo**: The authenticated app and auth screens show only the three-bar mark, without the Acme wordmark.
- **Blog covers**: Each sample journal post now has a product-frame cover. The list shows it to the left of the title at full container width; the article page already used the same `image` field.
- **Blog tags**: The journal list filters with `?tag=`. Tags on the list and article pages are links; the active tag (or All) clears the query.
- **Hero grid**: Removed the faint grid overlay from the marketing hero.
- **Trial copy**: FAQ and the billing journal post now say 7-day trials, matching `trialPeriodDays` in the payments config.
- **Hero highlights**: Removed the Authentication / Organizations / Billing row under the homepage preview.
- **Headline wrapping**: Left-aligned headlines and subtitles use `text-pretty` so the last line is less likely to leave a single word hanging. Centered headings still use `text-balance`.
- **Homepage sections**: Slightly tighter vertical padding so features, testimonials, pricing, FAQ, and the CTA sit closer together.

#### Dependencies

- **Production dependencies**: Bumped `ai` to `^7.0.62`, `@ai-sdk/openai` to `^4.0.40`, `@ai-sdk/react` to `^4.0.65`, `better-auth` and `@better-auth/passkey` to `1.6.27`, and `@aws-sdk/client-s3` and `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner` to `3.1108.0`. Refresh the lockfile with `pnpm install` after pulling. `pnpm-workspace.yaml` enforces `minimumReleaseAge: 1440` (one day) at install time.

## 2026-08-11

### Changed

#### Marketing redesign

- **Typography**: Marketing uses Inter for body copy and DM Sans for headlines (including the wordmark). `text-balance` is only on centered headlines and subtitles. The SaaS app uses Inter throughout.
- **Color scheme**: Shared tokens sit on Tailwind’s olive scale—warm olive-50 paper, olive-tinted borders, and olive-950 actions—so the high-contrast ink look picks up a quiet color, in the same family as the Oatmeal olive theme.
- **Marketing visual language**: Refreshed the public site toward a quieter Linear/Notion-like layout with UserJot-inspired structure—more vertical air, a left-aligned hero, stacked section titles with the lede underneath, a single bordered pricing table, and shared medium-weight page headers across blog, changelog, contact, and legal pages. A chromatic olive-green touch color is used like UserJot’s orange: a “New” pill, section labels, larger unboxed icons, checks, and secondary links. The faint hero grid stays; scroll reveals and hero fade-ins are gone.
- **Landing sections**: Added testimonials and a closing CTA band on the marketing homepage, with richer example copy across marketing locales plus clearer shared pricing descriptions.
- **Visual polish**: Hero uses a live dashboard wireframe (sidebar, stats, placeholder) instead of screenshots, feature placeholders are CSS product frames with dummy portraits and plan icons, testimonials include example headshots, pricing leads with the amount, and the newsletter is a compact closer instead of a second CTA.
- **Logo**: Replaced the layered hex SVG with a stacked three-bar Acme mark (thin rounded bars forming a pyramid) and a semibold wordmark in the shared `Logo` component.
- **Color mode toggle**: Moved the duplicated marketing/SaaS pickers into `@repo/ui`. Apps pass translated labels as props so the UI package stays free of `@repo/i18n`. The active option no longer uses a drop shadow.

#### Dependencies

- **Production dependencies**: Bumped `lucide-react` to `^1.31.0`, `react-dropzone` to `^20.1.0`, and `sonner` to `^2.0.8`. Refresh the lockfile with `pnpm install` after pulling. `pnpm-workspace.yaml` enforces `minimumReleaseAge: 1440` (one day) at install time.
- **Development dependencies**: Bumped `fumadocs-core` and `fumadocs-ui` to `16.14.3`, `fumadocs-mdx` to `15.2.3`, and `tsx` to `^4.23.12`.

## 2026-08-07

### Fixed

#### Auth

- **Social sign-in errors**: Failed OAuth/social sign-in API calls on the login and signup pages now show an error toast instead of failing silently.

#### Admin

- **User list after delete**: Invalidate the admin users query after removing a user so the deleted row leaves the list without a manual refresh.
- **Organization list caches**: Admin organization create/update/delete also invalidates the user organization switcher list.

#### Organizations

- **Leave organization**: Removing a member (including leave) refreshes both the members query and the organization list used by the switcher.

#### Settings

- **Active sessions after password change**: Changing a password with `revokeOtherSessions` invalidates the active sessions list.

#### Organizations

- **Invitation accept button**: The organization invitation modal Accept action now uses the primary button variant so it is visually distinct from Decline.

#### Permissions

- **Admin layout Permix race**: Nested admin layout no longer calls `permix.check` before the authenticated layout may have finished `setup()`. Uses `checkPermission` for the user-scoped `admin.access` gate instead.

### Changed

Refresh the lockfile with `pnpm install` after pulling. `pnpm-workspace.yaml` enforces `minimumReleaseAge: 1440` (one day) at install time.
- **Development dependencies**: Bumped `tsx` to `^4.23.8`.

## 2026-08-04

### Added

#### Admin

- **User bans**: Added admin controls to ban users with an internal reason and optional expiration, review active ban details, and unban users.

#### Developer tooling

- **Agent skills**: Added repository-scoped agent skills for common feature, auth, payments, database, docs, testing, and verification workflows.

#### Permissions

- **Permix authorization**: Introduced `@repo/permissions` with a typed permission matrix and `createPermissionRules` / `checkPermission` helpers. Wired Permix into oRPC (`permix/orpc`) for `adminProcedure` and organization/payment gates, and into the SaaS app via `permix/next` (server setup + dehydrate) and a client `PermixProvider` following the official Next.js integration (`setup` early, `dehydrate` → `PermixHydrate`, client `setup` for `isReady`, nested `setup` only when org context changes). UI guards use `permix.check` / `usePermissions().check` instead of scattered role string comparisons. `isOrganizationAdmin` / `isOrganizationOwner` remain as thin wrappers. Better Auth `organization.*` client endpoints stay on Better Auth's own access control. oRPC `protectedProcedure` sets user-scoped rules only (no per-request active-org membership fetch); org-scoped API checks resolve membership for the target organization. `checkPermission` reads the boolean matrix directly without constructing a Permix instance per call.

### Changed

#### Dependencies

- **Production dependencies**: Added `permix` `^4.1.2`. Bumped `@hookform/resolvers` to `^5.7.1`, `hono` to `^4.12.34`, and `react-dropzone` to `^20.0.0` (major upgrade: Node.js 22+ required, ESM-first package layout). Synced the lockfile for `fumadocs-mdx` `15.2.2`. Skipped `typescript` `7.x` (Next.js 16.2.x still probes `typescript/lib/typescript.js`, which TypeScript 7 no longer ships) and `@types/uuid` (deprecated). Refresh the lockfile with `pnpm install` after pulling. `pnpm-workspace.yaml` enforces `minimumReleaseAge: 1440` (one day) at install time.
- **Development dependencies**: Bumped `tsx` to `^4.23.5`.

## 2026-08-03

### Fixed

#### Auth

- **Login tab order**: Repositioned the forgot-password link so keyboard navigation moves from the password field to the password visibility toggle before leaving the field group.

#### UI

- **Base UI migration follow-ups**: Repaired button `render` composition, dropdown link grouping, select popup sizing, and destructive confirmation styling after the Base UI migration.

## 2026-07-31

### Fixed

- **Auth redirects**: Restricted login, signup, OTP, and onboarding redirects to normalized root-relative SaaS paths, preventing untrusted `redirectTo` values from navigating users to external sites.
- **SaaS indexing**: Added app-wide `noindex, nofollow` robots metadata so authentication and protected SaaS pages are not included in search results.

### Changed

#### Headless UI library: Radix UI → Base UI

- **Breaking**: `packages/ui` now builds on `@base-ui/react` instead of `radix-ui`, matching the TanStack Start version. Composition uses Base UI's `render` prop; the Radix `asChild` prop has been removed from all components (no compatibility shim).
  - `<Button asChild><Link href="/" /></Button>` becomes `<Button render={(props) => <Link {...props} href="/" />} />`.
  - `<DropdownMenuTrigger asChild><Button /></DropdownMenuTrigger>` becomes `<DropdownMenuTrigger render={<Button />} />`.
  - `DropdownMenuItem` rendering a link needs `nativeButton={false}` alongside `render`.
- **State attributes**: Radix `data-[state=open|closed|checked]` variants are replaced by Base UI `data-[open]`, `data-[closed]`, `data-[checked]`, `data-[starting-style]`, and `data-[ending-style]`. Custom styles targeting the old attributes must be updated.
- **CSS variables**: `--radix-accordion-content-height` → `--collapsible-panel-height`, `--radix-dropdown-menu-trigger-width` → `--anchor-width`.
- **Component API deltas**: `Tabs` uses `Tab`/`Panel` instead of `Trigger`/`Content`, `Accordion` takes `multiple`/`defaultValue` instead of `type`/`collapsible`, `TooltipProvider` takes `delay` instead of `delayDuration`, `DropdownMenuItem` uses `closeOnClick={false}` instead of `onSelect` + `preventDefault`, and `Select` accepts an `items` prop so `SelectValue` renders labels instead of raw values.
- **Dependencies**: Removed `radix-ui`, added `@base-ui/react` to the workspace catalog and `@repo/ui`.

#### Dependencies

- **Production dependencies**: Bumped `ai` to `^7.0.42`, `@ai-sdk/openai` to `^4.0.24`, `@ai-sdk/react` to `^4.0.45`, `@aws-sdk/client-s3` and `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner` to `3.1098.0`, `nuqs` to `^2.9.3`, `postcss` to `8.5.25`, and `stripe` to `^22.4.0`.

## 2026-07-27

### Fixed

#### API

- **Organization billing authorization**: Require organization membership when listing purchases and an owner or administrator role when creating organization checkout sessions. Inaccessible customer portal purchases now return `NOT_FOUND` to prevent resource enumeration.
- **Payment redirects**: Restrict checkout and customer portal return URLs to the configured SaaS application origin.
- **AI message validation**: Validate incoming UI messages with the AI SDK before converting them or invoking the model.

### Changed

#### API

- **Response contracts**: Added explicit, co-located Zod output schemas to every oRPC procedure and removed redundant notification response remapping.

#### SaaS app

- **Organization role select**: Removed secondary role descriptions from the organization role select and the unused translation keys so the selector shows only compact role names.

## 2026-07-17

### Changed

#### Apps

- **Favicons**: Aligned the marketing and docs favicon assets with the updated SaaS app icon so all shipped apps use the same rocket icon.

---

## 2026-07-16

### Fixed

- **Avatar crop dialog**: Contained the Cropper.js canvas and shade inside the dialog so resizing the crop area no longer overflows the modal. The initial crop selection is 95% of the available area so drag handles stay visible by default.

### Changed

#### Theme and UI

- **Font**: Replaced Figtree with Plus Jakarta Sans in the SaaS and marketing app layouts.
- **Color tokens**: Switched the shared theme from stone to zinc neutrals, with slate primary accents in light and dark mode (`tooling/tailwind/theme.css`).
- **Buttons**: Hover states use `color-mix` for primary/secondary/destructive, and outline buttons use foreground-based borders and hover fills.
- **Dialogs and menus**: Alert dialogs use `bg-card` with larger radius; dialogs use `rounded-2xl`; dropdown menus use `rounded-xl`.
- **Logo**: Slightly smaller default logo mark (`size-8`).

#### SaaS app

- **App shell**: Removed the floating content card. Navbar and main content share the same background and are separated by a border; content padding aligns with the navbar.
- **Navbar collapse**: Replaced the header toggle with a Vercel-style edge drag strip (hover chip) to expand/collapse the sidebar. Active nav items use a muted background instead of a bordered card. Expanded mode shows the logo label.
- **Organization select**: Card-styled trigger with tighter padding; dropdown uses a regular width with the trigger as min-width, and opens to the right when the sidebar is collapsed. Plan label line-height is tightened so the trigger height stays stable. Personal account uses a user icon (instead of the profile photo), drops the group title, and shows the “Personal account” label as the row text.
- **Organization grid**: Organization logos use rounded corners to match the refreshed card styling.
- **User menu**: Dropdown uses a regular width with the trigger as min-width; opens above (expanded), to the right (collapsed desktop), or below and right-aligned (mobile).
- **Auth screens**: Removed the bordered auth card wrapper; titles and subtitles are centered. Login/signup divider labels use `bg-background`.
- **Settings**: Simplified active sessions and connected accounts rows (no bordered cards); settings item headers get consistent bottom padding on wide layouts.
- **App icon**: Updated the SaaS app icon asset.

#### Marketing

- **Hero**: Dropped the primary-tinted gradient background; hero media frame uses `bg-muted`.
- **Consent banner**: Allow action uses the primary button variant explicitly.

#### Database

- **Two-factor authentication**: Added `failedVerificationCount` and `lockedUntil` to the `TwoFactor` model in Prisma and the PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite Drizzle schemas. Apply with your usual database push/migrate workflow.

#### Dependencies

- **Production dependencies**: Bumped `ai` to `^7.0.28`, `@ai-sdk/anthropic` to `^4.0.15`, `@ai-sdk/openai` to `^4.0.14`, `@ai-sdk/react` to `^4.0.30`, `@aws-sdk/client-s3` and `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner` to `3.1087.0`, and `openai` to `^6.47.0`. Synced the lockfile for catalog upgrades from previous runs (including major upgrades for `ai` 7.x, `@ai-sdk/*` 4.x, `cookie` 2.x, `cropperjs` 2.x, `nanoid` 6.x, and `react-dropzone` 17.x). Skipped `typescript` `7.x` (major upgrade pending ecosystem support) and `@types/uuid` (deprecated). Refresh the lockfile with `pnpm install` after pulling. `pnpm-workspace.yaml` enforces `minimumReleaseAge: 1440` (one day) at install time.
- **Development dependencies**: Bumped `oxlint` to `^1.74.0`, `oxfmt` to `^0.59.0`, and `turbo` to `^2.10.5`.

---

## 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- Removed the stale `cropperjs/dist/cropper.css` import from the SaaS app root layout. Cropper.js v2 ships its styles inside its web components, and the CSS file no longer exists in the package, which broke the Next.js production build. Aligned the avatar crop dialog with the TanStack Start implementation, including shade clipping and layout styles for the Cropper.js v2 web component API.

### Changed

#### Mail

- **Default provider**: Switched the default mail provider export from Plunk to Resend. The Plunk provider implementation and `PLUNK_API_KEY` example environment variable were removed.

#### Dependencies

- **Production dependencies**: Bumped `fumadocs-core` and `fumadocs-ui` to `16.11.4`, `fumadocs-mdx` to `15.1.1`, and `react-email` to `^6.8.1`.

Refresh the lockfile with `pnpm install` after pulling. `pnpm-workspace.yaml` enforces `minimumReleaseAge: 1440` (one day) at install time.
- **Development dependencies**: Bumped `postcss` to `8.5.19`. Skipped `turbo` `2.10.5` because it was published within the last 24 hours.

---

## 2026-06-16

### Fixes and improvements

#### SaaS app

- **Organization members**: Removed the role permissions summary box from the members settings page. Role descriptions now appear only inside the role select dropdown (capped to one line), and the select trigger shows only the role label for a compact layout.

### Changed

#### Dependencies

- **Development dependencies**: Bumped Turborepo to `2.9.18` and `@tailwindcss/typography` to `0.5.20`. Refresh the lockfile with `pnpm install` after pulling.

---

## 2026-06-06

### Changed

#### Dependencies

---

## 2026-06-02

### Fixes and improvements

#### SaaS app

- **Organization settings**: Only organization owners now see the delete organization section in general settings. Admins still retain access to the rest of organization settings.

---

### Removed

#### Auth

- **Username plugin**: Removed the Better Auth `username()` plugin along with the `username` and `displayUsername` columns from the Prisma and Drizzle user schemas. This eliminates the unauthenticated `POST /api/auth/is-username-available` endpoint, which allowed anonymous username enumeration. Apply the schema change with `pnpm --filter @repo/database push` (this drops the two columns).

---

## 2026-05-27

### Changed

#### Infrastructure

- **Node.js and pnpm**: The workspace now requires Node.js `>=22` and pins `pnpm@11.3.0`. Turborepo was upgraded to the latest 2.9.x release.
- **Dependabot**: Removed the open-pull-requests limit and Dependabot cooldown so daily upgrade PRs are no longer capped at two concurrent updates. `pnpm-workspace.yaml` still enforces `minimumReleaseAge: 1440` (one day) at install time.
- **Lint tooling**: Moved `oxlint-tsgolint` from root dependencies to devDependencies so it is only installed for development workflows.

---

## 2026-05-25

### Fixes and improvements

#### Payments

- **Stripe one-time checkout**: Creating a checkout link for a user or organization that already has a Stripe customer no longer sends `customer_creation` alongside `customer`, which Stripe rejects with a parameter conflict error.

#### Marketing and SaaS apps

- **Theme toggle**: `ColorModeToggle` defers reading `next-themes` until after mount so the marketing and SaaS toggles render consistent server markup and client hydration without `suppressHydrationWarning`, fixing the active indicator jumping or mismatching on first paint.

#### Marketing

- **Content Collections**: `content-collections` config now uses the `content` option instead of the deprecated `collections` field (0.14+ migration), keeping the marketing content pipeline on the supported API.

---

## 2026-05-21

### Fixes and improvements

#### SaaS app

- **Organization members**: Role selects are ordered member → admin → owner (least to most access). The members settings page includes a role permissions summary, and each role option shows a short description of what it can do.

---

## 2026-05-20

### Removed

#### Mail

- **NewUser template**: Removed the unused `NewUser` email template, its `mailTemplates` wiring, orphaned per-locale `mail.json` entries, and the `common.otp` string that was only referenced there. Signup and email changes continue to use the email verification template.

### Changed

#### Dependencies

- **Workspace prune**: Dropped direct dependencies that were never imported from their package trees, removed the `openapi-schema` helper that only supported the removed `openapi-merge` dependency, and refreshed the lockfile so installs stay lean while type-check and tests keep passing.

---

## 2026-05-18

### Changed

#### Mail

- **React Email 6**: The mail workspace now uses the unified `react-email` package (v6). Separate `@react-email/components` and `@react-email/render` dependencies were removed in favor of imports from `react-email`. The mail preview app replaces `@react-email/preview-server` with `@react-email/ui` per the v6 upgrade guide. Email templates were reformatted with oxfmt.

---

## 2026-05-13

### Fixes and improvements

#### Infrastructure

- **Dependency minimum release age**: A 1-day minimum release age is now enforced at two levels to reduce supply chain attack exposure. Dependabot is configured with `cooldown: default-days: 1` so upgrade PRs are not opened immediately for freshly published versions. `pnpm-workspace.yaml` sets `settings.minimumReleaseAge: 1440` (minutes) so pnpm v11+ will also refuse to install any package version younger than one day, including transitive dependencies. Together these ensure a community-detection window before newly published — potentially compromised — versions reach the project.
- **pnpm v11**: The monorepo now targets pnpm `11.1.1`, with package-manager-only build settings moved from the root `package.json` into `pnpm-workspace.yaml` so installs and CI behave correctly on the v11 toolchain.

#### Marketing and SaaS apps

- **Theme toggle**: Light/dark controls in the marketing and SaaS apps render with correct server markup and no longer rely on a client-only placeholder that hid the toggle before hydration.

---

## 2026-05-09

### Fixes and improvements

#### Database

- **Two-factor authentication schema**: Added the missing Better Auth `verified` flag to the `TwoFactor` Prisma model, generated Prisma Zod schema, and PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite Drizzle schemas so two-factor enrollment state is represented consistently across database adapters.

---

## 2026-05-06

### Fixes and improvements

#### SaaS app

- **Account security settings**: Passkeys can now be renamed from the passkey list, and the rename dialog opens automatically after creating a new passkey. The passkey list shows user-defined names without the device type prefix and falls back to “Unnamed passkey” for legacy passkeys without a saved name. The two-factor authentication block remains visible when a password has not been configured and now explains that a password is required before two-factor authentication can be enabled.

---

## 2026-04-24 v3.3.2

### Fixes and improvements

#### SaaS app

- **Organization general settings**: Organization name field now syncs when client data loads; success and error toasts use dedicated `organizations.settings` i18n keys. After renaming, the organization list query is refetched, the active organization is refreshed, and the name form resets to the saved value. The organization switcher no longer briefly shows “Personal account” when opening account settings with an active organization (active-org query keeps previous data across route key changes).

---

## 2026-04-20 v3.3.1

### Fixes and improvements

#### Database

- **Drizzle notifications and schema**: Notification persistence (preferences, insert support, listing rows, unread counts, mark read) is implemented in `@repo/database` for both Prisma and Drizzle, so the Drizzle scaffold no longer mixes in Prisma-style `db` calls. The Drizzle schema barrel (`drizzle/schema/index.ts`) re-exports the PostgreSQL schema (aligned with the Drizzle client) and exposes `NotificationType` / `NotificationTarget` for type-safe consumers.
- **`user.lastActiveOrganizationId` in Drizzle**: Added on PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite user tables so Drizzle schemas match the Prisma user model and auth hooks that read this field.
- **Organization lookups (Drizzle)**: `findFirst`-based helpers now normalize missing rows to `null`, matching Prisma `findUnique` behavior for tests and callers.

#### Packages

- **`@repo/notifications`**: Dropped the thin `list`, `mark-read`, and `preferences` modules; the package index re-exports the shared notification query helpers from `@repo/database` next to create/welcome/resolve-link.

#### API

- **Notifications procedures**: List and unread-count handlers use the database row helpers from `@repo/notifications` / `@repo/database` and apply `resolveNotificationLink` when shaping list responses.

#### SaaS app

- **Notification center**: Removed interval-based refetching of notifications from the notification center UI.

Related: [issue #2395](https://github.com/supastarter/supastarter-nextjs/issues/2395) (Drizzle + Postgres scaffold parity).

---

## 2026-03-30 v3.3.0

### Added

#### Database

- **Notification entity**: New `Notification` model in Prisma and Drizzle (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite) with user association and read/unread state.

#### Packages

- **`@repo/notifications`**: Shared module for notification definitions (`catalog`), creating and listing notifications, marking as read, per-user preferences, and a welcome notification helper.

#### API

- **Notifications oRPC**: Procedures to list notifications, get unread count, mark one or all as read, and read/update notification preferences.

#### SaaS app

- **Notification Center**: Navbar UI to view notifications and mark them read.
- **Notification preferences**: Account settings page and form for per-channel preferences; server-only notification logic is kept out of the client bundle for the preferences form.
- **Auth**: Database hook after user creation creates a welcome in-app notification via `@repo/notifications`.

#### Mail and i18n

- **`Notification` email template** and template wiring; **saas** and **mail** translation keys for notifications in English, German, Spanish, and French.

#### UI

- **Popover** and **Switch** components exported from `@repo/ui` for notification UI patterns.

### Changed

#### SaaS settings

- **Account and organization settings**: Removed nested `settings/layout.tsx` for account and org routes; settings sub-pages (general, billing, security, members, etc.) are updated to match the flatter structure. New **Notifications** route under account settings.

#### NavBar and theming

- **NavBar**: Reworked layout and behavior (including notification entry points); **Tailwind theme** (`tooling/tailwind/theme.css`) and related component tweaks for consistency.

---

## 2026-03-24 v3.2.0

### Testing

- **Vitest setup**: Added Vitest configuration (`vitest.config.ts`) to `apps/saas`, `apps/marketing`, and `packages/api` so unit tests can be run with `pnpm test` in each workspace package.
- **Unit tests**: Added initial unit test suites covering `base-url` helpers in both apps, content utilities in the marketing app, and organization membership logic, slug generation, and oRPC procedure wiring in the API package.
- **CI integration**: Added a unit test job to the GitHub Actions workflow so all unit tests run on every pull request; the Turbo `test` task no longer depends on `build`.

---

## 2026-03-24 v3.1.1

### Fixes and improvements

#### SaaS app

- **Checkout return after payment**: After Stripe checkout, users are redirected to `/checkout-return`, which polls `listPurchases` until an active plan appears (avoiding a race with webhook processing). The pricing table passes `organizationId` in the return URL when applicable. If confirmation does not arrive within the timeout, users are sent to `/choose-plan`. Added `checkoutReturn` copy in English, German, Spanish, and French.

---

## 2026-03-23 v3.1.0

### Tooling

- **Lint and format stack**: Replaced Biome with [Oxlint](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter) and [Oxfmt](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/formatter) for faster linting and formatting across the monorepo.
- **Workspace layout**: Consolidated Oxlint/Oxfmt dependencies at the repository root (pnpm catalog) and removed redundant per-package Biome configs; lockfile and many source files were updated to match the new rules and formatter output.

---

## 2026-03-18 v3.0.3

### Added

#### Organizations

- **Persist last active organization**: A new `lastActiveOrganizationId` field is stored on the user record whenever the active organization changes. On next sign-in, the session is automatically restored to that organization via a better-auth `databaseHook`, so users no longer land on a default/empty organization after logging back in.

---

## 2026-03-09 v3.0.2

### Fixes and improvements

#### Marketing app

- **Tailwind Typography**: Added `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin to the marketing app so `prose` and `prose-invert` classes render styled content correctly (blog posts, legal pages, changelogs)
- **Page spacing**: Normalized top padding across marketing pages (blog list, blog post, changelog, contact, legal) from `pt-24 pb-16` to `py-16` for consistent vertical rhythm
- **Image hostname**: Added `picsum.photos` to the allowed remote image hostnames in `next.config.ts` for blog placeholder images

---

## 2026-03-08 v3.0.1

### Fixes and improvements

#### i18n and translation usage

- **Single `useTranslations()` per component**: Removed redundant `useTranslations()` hooks (e.g. `tSignup`, `tLogin`, `tSettings`, `tPricing`, `tActions`, `tAria`, `tAvatar`, `tOrgSettings`) across marketing and SaaS components. Components now use a single `t` for all translation keys.
- **Color mode labels**: Marketing and SaaS `ColorModeToggle` now use the full key path `common.colorMode.${option.value}` for option labels.
- **Organization and settings keys**: `ChangeOrganizationNameForm` now uses `organizations.settings.changeName.notifications.success` / `error` and `settings.save` via the shared `t`; other organization and settings forms (delete org, logo, change email/name/password, two-factor) use the single `t` for their copy.

#### Payments and purchases

- **List purchases enrichment**: `listPurchases` (packages/api) now returns each purchase with resolved `planId` and `planPrice` from the payments helper, so clients receive plan data without extra lookups.
- **Purchase helper**: `createPurchasesHelper` and `getActivePlanFromPurchases` in `packages/payments` now accept a `ResolvedPurchase` type (with optional `planId` and `planPrice`) and use `resolvePurchasePlan` / `resolvePurchasePlanId` to avoid duplicate provider price resolution when purchases are already enriched.

#### UI

- **SaaS NavBar**: Nav link list uses `flex-nowrap`, `overflow-x-auto`, and responsive `md:overflow-visible md:flex-wrap` so links scroll horizontally on small screens and wrap on larger ones; sidebar layout keeps `md:flex-nowrap` for the vertical nav.

---

## 2026-03-08 v3.0.0

### Major architectural changes and breaking updates

This release restructures the monorepo around separate marketing and SaaS applications, expands localization, and reworks billing configuration. The major version bump reflects multiple breaking changes to app paths, imports, route structure, configuration, and payment data.

#### Summary of breaking changes

- **App split**: The former `apps/web` application has been split into dedicated `apps/marketing` and `apps/saas` Next.js apps
- **Route changes**: Marketing routes and SaaS auth/app routes moved into new App Router layouts and path groups
- **Config scoping**: Marketing and SaaS now use app-local `config.ts`, `types.ts`, and i18n request/config helpers instead of sharing `apps/web` config
- **Payments model**: Billing now uses plan-based configuration and provider `priceId` values instead of client-facing `productId`
- **Purchase schema**: Purchase records were renamed from `productId` to `priceId` across Prisma, Drizzle, and generated Zod schemas
- **i18n split**: Translations are now split by scope (`marketing`, `saas`, `mail`, `shared`) and loaded through a new `getMessagesForLocale` helper
- **Translation key updates**: Marketing and SaaS UI copy now uses full-length translation keys consistently across forms, nav, pricing, settings, admin, and auth flows
- **API removals**: The contact and newsletter API routers were removed from `packages/api`
- **Mail changes**: Newsletter signup email/template support was removed and mail rendering now resolves scoped translations from `@repo/i18n`
- **UI moves**: Several SaaS-specific UI primitives were moved out of `@repo/ui` into `apps/saas/modules/shared`
- **Workspace tooling**: The workspace now relies on a pnpm catalog for shared dependency versions

#### Dedicated marketing and SaaS applications

- **New apps**: Added standalone `apps/marketing` and `apps/saas` applications with their own `package.json`, `next.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, global styles, robots, layouts, config, and Playwright setup
- **Marketing app**: Public pages now live in `apps/marketing`, including home, blog index and post routes, changelog, contact, legal pages, sitemap generation, locale switching, and refreshed home-page sections
- **SaaS app**: Protected application routes now live in `apps/saas`, with separate authenticated and unauthenticated layouts, account dashboards, organization settings, onboarding, auth pages, and API routes
- **Removed**: Deleted the old combined `apps/web` app and its shared layouts, proxy, sitemap, and duplicated feature modules

**Migration steps:**

1. Update any scripts, deploy targets, env vars, or local workflows that referenced `apps/web`
2. Point public-site work to `apps/marketing` and protected-product work to `apps/saas`
3. Update route assumptions for auth pages (`/login`, `/signup`, etc.) and SaaS app layouts if you maintain custom links or middleware

#### Localization and content restructuring

- **Scoped translations**: Split locale files into `packages/i18n/translations/{locale}/marketing.json`, `saas.json`, `mail.json`, and `shared.json`
- **New locales**: Added Spanish (`es`) and French (`fr`) alongside English and German
- **Typed config**: Added typed i18n config/interfaces and exported `config`, `Locale`, and scoped message types from `@repo/i18n`
- **Message loading**: Added `getMessagesForLocale(locale, scope)` with shared-message merging and default-locale fallback behavior
- **Key normalization**: Updated marketing and SaaS components to use explicit full-length translation keys instead of shorter or ambiguous key paths
- **App wiring**: Marketing and SaaS now each own their locale request/update helpers and locale-aware providers

**Migration steps:**

1. Move any custom translation keys into the new scoped translation files
2. Replace imports of old flat message utilities with `getMessagesForLocale`
3. Rename any custom UI translation lookups that still rely on older short-form key paths
4. Update any code that assumed only `en` and `de` locales exist

#### Payments, auth, and data model updates

- **Plan-based checkout**: `createCheckoutLink` now accepts `planId`, `type`, and optional `interval`, then resolves provider price IDs server-side
- **Payments config**: Replaced `productId` pricing config with typed plan definitions, `priceId` fields, `requireActiveSubscription`, and reusable plan lookup helpers
- **Purchase queries**: `listPurchases` now accepts an optional input object by default, simplifying direct server/client calls
- **Database schema**: Renamed purchase `productId` to `priceId` in Prisma and generated validation output
- **Auth updates**: Better Auth now uses the SaaS base URL, raises the minimum password length to 8, reserves `chatbot` as an organization slug, and updates invitation redirects to `/login` and `/signup`

**Migration steps:**

1. Rename any custom purchase schema usage from `productId` to `priceId`
2. Update payment integrations to pass `planId` and `interval` rather than provider product IDs
3. Regenerate and apply database migrations if your environment still uses the old purchase column name
4. Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_SAAS_URL` and payment provider price env vars are set for the new split-app setup

#### Mail, API, and shared component cleanup

- **Removed API endpoints**: Deleted the contact and newsletter oRPC modules from `packages/api`
- **Mail package refactor**: Moved mail helpers into `packages/mail/lib`, added scoped mail translation loading, and removed the newsletter signup template/export
- **Marketing forms**: Marketing contact/newsletter flows were refactored along with the new app split rather than continuing to rely on the removed shared API modules
- **SaaS UI ownership**: Moved password input, settings list/item, page header, and related shared components into the SaaS app to avoid over-generalizing them in `@repo/ui`
- **Workspace cleanup**: Added pnpm catalog version management and refreshed package wiring across apps and packages

---

## 2026-03-05 v2.0.6

### Refactoring

#### oRPC server-side client and payments

- **Server-side oRPC**: Introduced a server-only oRPC client that calls the API router directly (no HTTP) during SSR. Added `@orpc/server` (1.13.6) to `apps/web`, new `orpc.server.ts` that sets `globalThis.$orpcClient` via `createRouterClient(router, ...)`, and `instrumentation.ts` plus root layout import so the server client is registered before use.
- **orpc-client**: Client now throws on the server ("RPCLink is not allowed on the server side") and uses `window.location.origin` for the RPC URL; exports `orpcClient` as `globalThis.$orpcClient ?? createORPCClient(link)` so server code uses the direct router client.
- **API**: `packages/api` now exports `router`; `payments.listPurchases` procedure returns the purchases array directly instead of `{ purchases }`.
- **Payments**: Removed `getPurchases` and `apps/web/modules/saas/payments/lib/server.ts`. Account and organization billing pages and choose-plan page now call `orpcClient.payments.listPurchases()` directly; removed `attemptAsync` (es-toolkit) in favor of direct `await`. `usePurchases` hook updated to use `data ?? []` to match the new procedure return shape.

---

## 2026-03-05 v2.0.5

### Fixes

#### SaaS app layout – purchase list organization scoping

- **Payments / organizations**: When redirecting unsubscribed users to the choose-plan page, `organizationId` is now only passed to the payments list when organizations are enabled **and** billing is attached to the organization (`billingAttachedTo === "organization"`). Previously, `organizationId` was passed whenever organizations were enabled, which could incorrectly scope or look up purchases by organization when billing was configured at the user level and cause a redirect loop.

---

## 2026-03-02 v2.0.4

### Dependency updates

#### oRPC upgrade

- **@orpc packages**: Upgraded from 1.13.2 to 1.13.6 across the monorepo
- **apps/web**: Updated `@orpc/client` to 1.13.6
- **packages/api**: Updated `@orpc/client`, `@orpc/json-schema`, `@orpc/openapi`, `@orpc/server`, and `@orpc/zod` to 1.13.6

---

## 2026-02-05 v2.0.3

   ```
2. If using custom mail provider, migrate to one of the supported providers:
   - Resend
   - Nodemailer
   - Mailgun
   - Postmark
   - Plunk
   - Console (for development)
3. Update mail provider configuration to use `packages/mail/config.ts`

**Migration steps:**

1. If you have custom Biome rules, ensure they follow the new pattern:
   ```json
   {
   	"root": false,
   	"extends": "//"
   }
   ```
2. Run `pnpm format` to apply new formatting rules
3. Run `pnpm lint` to check for any linting issues with new config

     - `Passkey`: `@@index([userId])` and `@@index([credentialID])`
     - `TwoFactor`: `@@index([secret])` and `@@index([userId])`
     - `Member`: `@@index([organizationId])` and `@@index([userId])`
     - `Invitation`: `@@index([organizationId])` and `@@index([email])`
   - Add `createdAt DateTime @default(now())` field to the `Invitation` model

These changes improve database query performance through additional indexes and align with better-auth 1.4's new plugin architecture where passkey functionality is now a separate package.

### Updated dependencies

---

## 2025-11-03 v1.0.1

### Updated React type definitions

Updated `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` from version 19.0.0 to 19.2.2 to include the latest type definitions and bug fixes for React 19.

The pnpm overrides have been consolidated to the root `package.json` for better consistency across the monorepo.

### Optimized pnpm dependency installation

Added `onlyBuiltDependencies` configuration to pnpm settings to optimize installation time by only building Prisma-related packages (`@prisma/client`, `prisma`, and `prisma-zod-generator`) when needed. This reduces unnecessary rebuilds and speeds up dependency installation in the monorepo.

### Added pg dependency

Added `pg` (PostgreSQL client) as a dependency to support the Prisma Rust-free client migration. The `pg` package is required by the Prisma database adapter for PostgreSQL connections.

## 2025-11-03 v1.0.0

### Prisma client migration to Rust-free client

In order to reduce the bundle size of the client and improve performance, we have migrated to the Rust-free Prisma client.

#### Migration steps

If you are upgrading your supastarter project to this version, you need to update the way your prisma client is generated:

1. Update `prisma` and `@prisma/client` to the latest version.

2. In the `schema.prisma` file, change the `provider` to `prisma-client`, the `output` to `./generated` and set the `engineType` to `client`.

3. Update the `packages/database/prisma/client.ts` like this:

```ts
import { PrismaPg } from "@prisma/adapter-pg";
import { PrismaClient } from "./generated/client";

const prismaClientSingleton = () => {
	if (!process.env.DATABASE_URL) {
		throw new Error("DATABASE_URL is not set");
	}

	const adapter = new PrismaPg({
		connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
	});

	return new PrismaClient({ adapter });
};

declare global {
	var prisma: undefined | ReturnType<typeof prismaClientSingleton>;
}

// biome-ignore lint/suspicious/noRedeclare: This is a singleton
const prisma = globalThis.prisma ?? prismaClientSingleton();

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") {
	globalThis.prisma = prisma;
}

export { prisma as db };
```

In case are using a different database than PostgreSQL, see the following documentation on which adapter to use: https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/no-rust-engine#3-install-the-driver-adapter

### Next.js 16 migration

If you are updating an existing project, work through the following steps to align with the new Next.js 16 defaults and Supastarter conventions:

1. Upgrade `next`, `react`, and `react-dom` to their latest stable releases in both `package.json` files (`package.json` at the root and `apps/web/package.json` if it exists).

2. Rename the middleware entry point:
   - Move `apps/web/middleware.ts` to `apps/web/proxy.ts`.
   - Inside the renamed file update the exported handler to `export function proxy(...)` (it was previously `middleware`).

3. Remove the inline ESLint configuration from `apps/web/next.config.ts`

4. Update the marketing docs layout `apps/web/app/(marketing)/[locale]/docs/[[...path]]/layout.tsx`, by changing the `DocsLayout` prop from `disableThemeSwitch` to `themeSwitch={{ enabled: true }}`.

See https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16 for full migration guide (beyond the supastarter codebase).

### Biome 2.3 upgrade

We have upgraded to Biome 2.3 which introduces some changes to how CSS files are handled and it currently doesn't support the format in which Tailwind CSS 4 is configured, so you need to update the `biome.json` file to ignore the `globals.css` file for now:

```jsonc
{
	"files": {
		"includes": [
			"**",
			"!zod/index.ts",
			"!tailwind-animate.css",
			"!!**/globals.css", // <- ignore this file
		],
	},
	"css": {
		"parser": {
			"tailwindDirectives": true, // <- enable tailwind directives parsing
		},
	},
}
```
